1) As the hidden nodes increase, the accuracy of the model increases up to 5 hidden nodes. As the number  of hidden nodes increase further, the accuracy of the model seems to decrease, but with a smaller gradient than it increased from 1-3 hidden layers.
2)Initial Increase: Adding more hidden units initially improves accuracy significantly because the network can learn more complex patterns and features from the data.

Saturation: Beyond a certain point (around 3-5 hidden units in this case), the accuracy gains diminish, indicating that the network has enough capacity to capture the data's patterns, and adding more units doesn't provide substantial benefits.

Overfitting Risks: Slight decreases in accuracy at higher numbers of hidden units (e.g., 20 units) suggest potential overfitting, where the model captures noise rather than useful patterns.

Stabilization: The accuracy stabilizes around a high value (90-91%), showing that the model reaches an optimal complexity with a relatively small number of hidden units, balancing learning capacity and generalization.
